# Decisions

## Why Vue?

This is the first web app I've written, but I've seen it frequently mentioned
that Vue is particularly easy to pick up and learn, and is very useful for
rapid prototyping.

With that in mind, I picked Vue to write this web app.

It may be that this app would be better, faster, and/or more securely written
in a different framework - which could be something to explore in future iterations
of this web app.

## Why aren't there any tests?

I found that there was not enough time to learn how to test Vue components
in the time allotted for this task, although it would very much be my next step.

## Why isn't there a backend?

I decided that the overhead of learning a backend framework was possibly a little
too much for this task, given my very recent introduction to web development via this
code task.

I also found that it was straightforward enough to write the functionality 
I needed entirely in the frontend. Seeing as the data wasn't enormous, 
I made the compromise of loading the data client-side.

## Why can I only search by name?

This was due to time limitations - my next step after setting up unit testing would
be to make the results searchable by the other fields present in the data.
